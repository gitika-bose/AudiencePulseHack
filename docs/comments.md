    - How far can their context go before agents start forgetting previous conversations? What can be done about context management?
4. Does it take images? 
5. How to clear context for an agent?

# Suggestions
1. Ability to work with local/cheaper models. Google is a good one, Ollama and Deepseek as well.
2. Parallel agent generation. Agent generation takes time, maybe parallelize it
